# Approved Implementation Workflow

Use after an OpenSpec proposal is approved, or after Direct Change has
classified and authorized an implementation that will use an external agent.

## OpenSpec And Superpowers Boundary

1. OpenSpec proposal/design/spec deltas are the approved change contract.
2. For OpenSpec-required work, that approval is the single design approval and
   does not require a duplicate `docs/superpowers/specs/` artifact or approval.
3. After approval, invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` for multi-step work and
   save the executable plan under the project-preferred path.
4. OpenSpec `tasks.md` tracks contract progress; it does not replace the plan.
5. A compact Direct Change needs no large plan unless complexity justifies it.

## Plan And Evidence Granularity

- Group work by complete business slice, not by file count or technical layer.
- Include exact files, test commands, evidence profile, batch profile, negative
  searches, acceptance, rollback, and stop conditions.
- Apply Step Evidence Gate before and after each business slice or risk
  milestone, not every TDD micro-step. TDD owns RED/GREEN inside the slice.
- Use `superpowers:systematic-debugging` before changing unexplained failures.
- Use `superpowers:test-driven-development` for behavior changes, not for a
  test-only assertion of already-defined behavior.

## Inline Implementation

1. Execute the plan inline with TDD/debugging as applicable.
2. Run slice verification.
3. For `compact`, run a focused diff/self-review.
4. For `standard` or `strict` inline implementation, invoke
   `superpowers:requesting-code-review` after implementation and before final
   verification. Review PASS is required.
5. Any finding returns to the same slice: fix, refresh verification, and Review
   again. Do not carry unresolved findings into the next slice.

## External Implementation

1. Create one schema-version-2 Handoff Contract at canonical `status.md`.
2. A Direct Change may use `compact`/`single`; OpenSpec-backed work uses its
   approved evidence and batch profiles.
3. Hand Brief/Report/Review attempts to `codex-brief-antigravity-review`.
4. The external Review is the batch code-review gate; do not duplicate it with
   a second Superpowers review for the same batch.
5. `FAIL` or `BLOCKED` stays on the same batch and must re-enter Review with
   fresh attempt evidence.
6. Non-final `PASS` advances one batch. Final `PASS` sets
   `awaiting-final-verification` and returns ownership to this router.

## Final Completion

After all inline slices pass, or after external handback:

1. Run fresh `final_critical` once. Later implementation changes invalidate it.
2. Review final diff, scope, tests/logs, documentation/contract consistency,
   sensitive information, temporary files, and unrelated changes.
3. If Review or verification fails, return to implementation and repeat the
   fix -> verify -> Review loop.
4. Invoke `superpowers:verification-before-completion` before any success claim.
5. Mark external lifecycle `complete` only when final verification and Review
   both pass; otherwise report `FAIL` or `BLOCKED` with the next owner/action.

For OpenSpec-backed multi-step work, skip the Superpowers plan only when the
user explicitly says to skip it. Compact Direct Change does not require a large
plan by default. Never skip final verification or Review.
